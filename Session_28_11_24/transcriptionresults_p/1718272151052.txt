 The place is right next to a busy road. There are lots of cars and other vehicles running on the road. There are not too many people walking but there are a few walking along the road. There are two or three big buildings on the side of the road and there's a small little park like thing and there are a few trees spread green and right in the middle of that small little park there is a structure a monument kind of thing made out of metal. When there are lots of cars running at the same time on the street it's kind of noisy but on the other hand there are lots of birds singing and chirping so that gives a nice vibe to the environment. A few blocks from here there is some construction going on probably that is also causing some noise as well. Leaves and the flowers are falling down from the trees. The temperature is mild as well it's sunny.
