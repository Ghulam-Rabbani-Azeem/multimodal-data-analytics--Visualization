 For the most part, the place seems really calm and really not that crowded or noisy. But occasionally there are some heavy trucks and lots of cars running on the street, but at the time it's kind of noisy. But the added singing of the birds and cold breeze blowing through the trees, it gives a really nice and pleasant kind of vibe. I feel really good. There are some seating areas in the little park, and there are people taking their dogs, walking their dogs. That kind of adds to the pleasantness of the place. There are not too many people walking, so it's kind of a secluded and peaceful place. So I feel really good.
