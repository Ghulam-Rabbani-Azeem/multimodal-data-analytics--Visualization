 I find this place to be moderately pleasing because there are shades, tree shades around and then empty seats around to sit and relax for a while. Also the fresh air but I think this place will get crowded soon and I will get really nervous around and then I will have to quickly move out of here otherwise I cannot feel comfortable in this place.
