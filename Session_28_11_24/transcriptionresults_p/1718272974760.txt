 This place seems quite busy area and there are many residents living in this area too. There's a small kind of park where people can sit and there's also construction here, there's construction going on and there's small bicycle track where people can ride bicycles. So it should be convenient for all kind of users, all kind of people travelling. I think it has trees as well, a good place to have a good place to spend the time. People can sit and they can chit chat, this should be a good place.
