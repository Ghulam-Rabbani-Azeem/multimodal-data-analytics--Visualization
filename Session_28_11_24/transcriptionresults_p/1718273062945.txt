 I feel I feel it's a one can think of there are trees one can come and sit under the shade of the tree we should make it kind of relaxing but the noise I think would make one self kind of frustrated because there are vehicles this is a busy road so looks busy road so I think one won't prefer this place to sit during kind of frustration or hesitation so I won't prefer that and there are residential areas here so if one go one if one goes inside through the power through this road not to the main highway but to the inner part then it would be I think easy I mean it would be kind of relaxing because it's peaceful inside but the outside here is really monotonous
