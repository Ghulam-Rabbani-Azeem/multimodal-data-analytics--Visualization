 This place seems to be like a really busy street in the middle of the city. Right in front of where I'm standing right now there is a big tram line and there are trams running occasionally. There are lots of people, it's really crowded. People are walking everywhere and there are some bikers as well. And there are many cafes and clothing stores, fashion stores. On the side of the road there are some sales people selling some things. Even though it's really crowded it's not that noisy. And there is some occasional sound of birds singing as well.
