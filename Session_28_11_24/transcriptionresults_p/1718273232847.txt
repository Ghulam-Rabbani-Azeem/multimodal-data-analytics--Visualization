 The place I find to be a little quieter but it looks kind of busy at the same time because lots of cars are parked around but there is not much noise of the vehicles and also there are some trees around and stairs of the trees but I do not see much place to sit around and also there are some construction going around and there is some there is a historic building also I think it looks really nice.
