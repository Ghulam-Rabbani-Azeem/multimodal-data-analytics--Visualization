 So the place is nice. I hear a lot of birds, a lot of small animals in the park and it makes me calm but right next to the park there's a little busy road and there are a lot of cars as well which which makes the environment a little bit noisy and a little bit anxious. I hear ambulances and police cars in the background which makes me a little bit anxious as well and other than that there's nice green lawn. The grass is a bit big but it's a nice green lawn and the weather is quite nice so it's a little bit calming but yeah the noise is a little too much.
