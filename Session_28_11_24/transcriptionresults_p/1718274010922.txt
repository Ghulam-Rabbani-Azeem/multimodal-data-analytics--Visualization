 This place is on the middle of a cross-section and there is parking space right in front of the place. It's really quiet for most of the park. There are occasional bikes and cars running around. There are not too many people. There seem to be a few restaurants and it's really quiet in that sense. And there was some kind of construction going on nearby so there was some kind of drilling noise. And talking about the buildings and structures, there are few old cathedrals and tall old buildings. Seems like this is a residential area so there isn't too much crowd. There's a group of people nearby sitting right outside the restaurant. Overall it's really crowded and not too busy of street.
