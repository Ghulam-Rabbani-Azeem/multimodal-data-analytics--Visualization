 Well, I find this place very safe. I find it very relaxing. One could come and simply sit down. There are also trees and can rest during their exertion. They can have some good time. People, they come here and enjoy the food. There are some restaurants and there are also some, there is also a bakery where people can come and just eat and enjoy, have a good time. Since there are no bikes, it's totally very, very safe from that point of view as well. It's a really good place.
