 The place is really quiet I like that part. There are few trees so when it's really sunny you can simply stand right under the tree so that we did you can see it with stand doing right now so that feels really pleasant. There are few restaurants and few places here and there so there is something to do. There is not there aren't too many people walking and because of that I can't stand here for quite a longer period of time. Disregarding some of the noisy cars driving by but that's not that often. Right next to me there is an old cathedral church kind of thing that looks interesting so all in all I feel really excited and happy to be standing on this place.
