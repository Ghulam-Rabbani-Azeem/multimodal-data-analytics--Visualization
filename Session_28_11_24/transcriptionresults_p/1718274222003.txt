 I find this place to be quite useful because lots of people are walking around and I should really care when walking as well. Maybe I could step on someone else's foot or I can hit the bike. Sometimes there are vehicles coming in the middle of the road which seems like a footpath as well but it's kind of risky as well. But I like the place overall because there are sets around, place to eat and it is really clean as well.
