 I feel a little stressed and tired. One reason is that this is the last location and I have worked for a long time. Now I am a little bit hungry. Secondly, the busy traffic and the people also make me nervous because I have to avoid them. There is not much greenery here and I am standing in the sun so I feel hot and stressed.
