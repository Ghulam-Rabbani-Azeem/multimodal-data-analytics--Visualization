 standing here right now I have some mixed feelings especially because even though the place has a lot of trees and greenery and the bird humming which is quite relaxing but at the same time because the street is connected to a main road there's a lot of traffic going on as well which counterbalances the whole situation and I don't feel too connected to the place because it because of the traffic it feels like you're standing at a wrong point where you should move to a more calm place
