 This place looks like one of the main streets of the city. It's quite busy. There are lots of clothing stores, fashion stores, lots of restaurants. People are sitting outside, enjoying their lunch. People are walking by, shopping and whatnot. People are sitting under the trees, just relaxing. Overall, even though there are lots of people, it's not noisy or unpleasant at all. Actually, it feels really lively and I'm finding that people are using their bikes and just traveling through the road. There are a few trees, so there is a little bit greenery around.
