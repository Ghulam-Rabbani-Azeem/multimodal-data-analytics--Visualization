 I feel this place a very hot place, doing it special during the summer I think because there are all you can see is very few trees, very few trees and on a hot sunny day it's very difficult to walk and the temperature, if the temperature is high then there's no thing to sit down and cool or make oneself fresh. There's no any place to sit as well so from that point of view although it's not so comfortable or not a very vibrant place vehicles also keep moving quite more that's why I think this is busy and from that point of view it's not so suitable but either way it's a way too fast so from the mobility point of view it's okay that one can move from one place to another. I think there are shortcuts so it's okay it's good
