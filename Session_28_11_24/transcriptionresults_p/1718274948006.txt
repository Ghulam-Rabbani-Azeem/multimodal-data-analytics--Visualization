 Standing on the side of the street on sidewalk I am really enjoying this time here. It feels like this is the go-to place in the city. Lots of things to do, lots of restaurants, lots of stores to check out, lots of shopping to do. It's not that busy in the sense that it's not noisy but there are quite a lot of people walking and just sitting outside enjoying their lunch. It looks like there are a few good restaurants to grab a quick bite. I feel relaxed because there are not too many trees but there are still a few and there are some seating areas right underneath the trees which gives you a nice place to sit and relax for a bit. So overall I'm really enjoying and liking the place.
