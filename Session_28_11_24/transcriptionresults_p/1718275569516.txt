 This place is also on the side of a really busy street. There are lots of cars parked right outside of the street but the traffic is not that heavy. There are a few people walking on the side of the street. Since I'm standing right next to the street there are I can hear people talking and walking right next to me. There are some cars and bikes that's running on the street and there are lots of restaurants, salon, clothing store, health stores, different all different kinds of stores and sometimes the traffic can be noisy because right now two bikes just walked right past me and it's kind of noisy right now. I'm talking about the buildings there are all the buildings seems to be of the same size and size. They're not too tall, not too big and most of the space around this place is occupied by some kind of store.
