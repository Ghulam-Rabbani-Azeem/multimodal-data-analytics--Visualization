 In general even though there are lots of cars and lots of stores and lots of people walking around the street it's not that busy and not that noisy so I'm relatively calm and happy to be standing here. The weather is really good that's helping a lot. There is some occasional noise after traffic which is not bothering at all so I can stay here for a longer period of time and seems like there are lots of stores and lots of things to do around here so that should be interesting and people seem to be relaxed and I feel safe and I'll be happy to visit this place again.
