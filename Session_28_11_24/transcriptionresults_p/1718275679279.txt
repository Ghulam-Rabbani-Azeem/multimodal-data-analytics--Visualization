 I feel really calm and at peace in this place because it's really peaceful there's not a lot of noise not a lot of traffic and like the crowded not a big crowd either it's just a couple of cars going by on the road nearby that sort of creates some noise and disturbance that's the reason for the disturbance but the reasons I feel calm here are because of the birds the like light wind passing through and all of the different colors that are really calming and soothing on the ice and I also like the sun shining really down on on this road and on my face it feels really warm and really peaceful and calm so yeah
