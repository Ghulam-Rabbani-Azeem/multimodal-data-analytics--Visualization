 So I'm at the corner of K3 Nengar and Mall Hart classic. It's a nice little corner. There are a couple of food shops here and there. There are nice restaurants with a lot of people sitting inside. Then there's an old chapel in the corner. It's quite magnificent as well. There are a lot of benches all around the street. There are a bunch of people and it's an old part of the town. It's very nice and very calm.
