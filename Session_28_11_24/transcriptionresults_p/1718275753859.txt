 Here the places are comparatively congested, smaller narrow ways but there are restaurants and people can just sit and eat. So this is a very kind of crowded. People are here, there are bicycles so people either travel on foot or they travel by bike but mostly the bikes are just parked meaning that it may like they just park and then they have some good time here. There are also some offices, there are some cafes, there are some restaurants here. People come, they sit, they chit chat and there are some people just eating and enjoying having a good time.
