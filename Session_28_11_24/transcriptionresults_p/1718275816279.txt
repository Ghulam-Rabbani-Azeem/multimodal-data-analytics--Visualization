 This is a very nice change of place. There is a lot of calm and quiet environment. I don't hear a lot of birds, but I hear a lot of people getting food. It's almost lunch time, so I see a lot of people in the lines for food. I see a lot of children playing here and there, and it's very nice, very calming. The breeze is also nice. I smell a lot of different kind of smell of flowers all around me. I see a lot of people cycling around as well, enjoying the summer breeze. It's very nice, very calming. There are a bunch of houses, and of course there is a chapel in the corner. The architecture is really fascinating as well, so it's a nice scenery as well. Definitely I'm not getting bored sitting here and looking at all around me.
