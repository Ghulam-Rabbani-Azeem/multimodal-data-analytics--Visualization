 This place is also surrounded by buildings. It has a small pathway and there are some restaurants and some cafes but not as much as the previous one. So there is a small road where both bikes and four wheelers travel. There are many bikes and vehicles parked meaning I think it could be because people are so much, mainly people live here more often. The pedestrian path is also quite busy mostly so people travel on foot most of the time. There are no trees, all I find is buildings and vehicles parked.
