 Well I find this place a bit crowded so there are some narrow pedestrian paths so there could be a chance that there might be a chance of exhaustion or maybe people who are feeling very frustrated or tired might find this place even more exhaustive and it is so it is there are apartments so nearby I think I won't choose to live in this place because there are just vehicles passing and might not feel so peaceful and I don't think people would also find it good to travel on travel by travel on vehicles here because it is a small and congested road so my people my may feel they congested while traveling on vehicles so the for bicycle it's also not not so very convenient because almost the entire road is covered by the vehicles I mean by the four wheelers so not very useful
