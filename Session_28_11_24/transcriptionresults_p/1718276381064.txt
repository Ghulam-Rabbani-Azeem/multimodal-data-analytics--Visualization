 Right now I am standing below a tall chapel and the architecture on this chapel seems to be very amazing as well. Other than that the whole street is very crowded probably because there are multiple restaurants over here and people seems to be very happy about the weather as well because it's a sunny day. Right now they prefer sitting outside under the umbrellas and having their food and there are other tourists as well. I believe this place is very significant in terms of the overall location in the city and people are really enjoying the weather as well.
