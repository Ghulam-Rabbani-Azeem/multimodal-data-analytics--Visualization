 Right now I feel very excited and hungry at the same time. Hungry because there are a lot of restaurant options I guess. I am very excited specially because of the architecture of the chapel and just thinking about how it would look like from the inside. Right now it seems to be closed for some reason. But other than that it is a warm sunny day and standing below like the shadow of tree it is very soothing. And also because people are enjoying the weather they are having a good laugh which makes the overall environment very pleasant.
