 So we are somewhere between the streets in a busy market, central area and this is like an intersection of two streets and there's like very nice really small cafeterias everywhere and there's like people sitting outside and having food and drinks and there's like some shopping places and a jewelry shop and there's just buildings all around. It's not really a wide big street for cars. It's more like just for walking and there's different sorts of buildings and a mall and I can see some parking area for some bikes in the distance and I can also see like a big red building. It looks like a church or something. It's really tall. The tower and there's also the famous Galleria Mall over here and a couple of bars and restaurants.
