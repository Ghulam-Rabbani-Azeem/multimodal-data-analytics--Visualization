 I feel really calm here. Not really much to take interest in over here, just people busy in their lives and like everybody is doing their own thing. Some of the shops are empty and nobody is in there so there is not a lot of interesting things to observe. However, the big red building, it kind of fascinates me. It looks interesting, the color and the architecture on it, it caught my eye. But other than that, I just don't really feel interested in anything over here. It's just normal.
