 So this is a street behind like a really big cathedral or like a church. Yeah, it looks like a big church here. It's got like these off white beige colored walls. And there's, it opens up into an intersection where there's like this really nice looking colorful yellow walled building. It has apartments in it. And then there's like a hotel next to it. And there's like this hotel and next to it are like these restaurants. And there's like another clock tower with like a church or a cathedral tower that I can see behind the hotel from this street view. And on the other end of the street I can see like this really big crane. Probably some construction going on in the distance because of that. And yeah, there's a parking area. There's cars over here of different colors and some shade to stand under next to the church.
