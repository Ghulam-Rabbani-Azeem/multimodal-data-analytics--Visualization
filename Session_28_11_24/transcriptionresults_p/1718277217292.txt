 The place I am standing right now, there are a lot of residential apartments as well as commercial buildings as well. There are few restaurants I can see as well. Other than that the road is full of cars, most of them are parked but because this is a connecting point between multiple roads, I can hear a lot of traffic as well. There are some buildings that I think are restaurants and some are bakeries but other than that there are a lot of residential apartments as the parking is full.
