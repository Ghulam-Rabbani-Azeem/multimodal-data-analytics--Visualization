 It's really peaceful and quiet. I feel really at peace over here and quiet. There's just a couple of cars going by that make a bit of noise. That's a little bit stressful. There's like a car that was just started in the parking lot that's engine the engine made some noise but other than that it's really peaceful. It's quiet. The church is quiet. The apartments are really quiet. So yeah it's I feel chilled, normal, relaxed, mellowed out. I could like just take a walk here, stand under the shade, find a place to sit. The restaurant looks like it could it could be nice place to have a coffee at and see just people going by.
