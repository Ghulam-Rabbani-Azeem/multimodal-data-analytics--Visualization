 So I'm going to Aunt Frances's, uh, Denner Futs. Um, and, uh, it's a nice, nice little, uh, parking lot, uh, in the corner. Uh, and I see a bunch of different small restaurants and a bank in the corner as well. Uh, behind me is, uh, Great White Chapel, uh, with a lot of different carvings all around its walls. Um, it's nice little place. Uh, there are a lot of hustle bustle going all around. Uh, I see a lot of people, uh, going for their groceries. I see a lot of cars as well. Uh, it seems like a very busy road, um, and I see a lot of people cycling as well. Um, uh, there are a bunch of trees as well, um, here and there. But it's not very green, it's a lot urban. Um, it seems like a little, uh, dirty as well as compared to other parts of the city. Uh, I see a lot of different houses, uh, rental complexes on the corner. Um, so a lot of different, uh, things to see, uh, in this, in this part of the city.
