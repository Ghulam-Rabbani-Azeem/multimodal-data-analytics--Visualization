 Right now I am actually agitated by the sound of construction going on close to me. Other than that being a main road there is a lot of traffic as well. And there is no greenery or trees to stand below which makes it more difficult to stand just directly below the sun. And this is not a very relatable place or a very pleasant place to be.
