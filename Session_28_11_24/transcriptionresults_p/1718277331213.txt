 So this is a very noisy part of the city. Of course it's all old town but it still has a lot of cars and a lot of different residential buildings as well. There's a church on the corner with a lot of interesting diagrams and a lot of history. It seems like it has a lot of history which is intriguing for me but other than that it's a very ordinary street with a lot of hustle and bustle. I see a lot of cars, I see different people walking around on the street so it makes me a little bit anxious. There's construction going on down the street as well so it's a lot noisy as compared to other places inside the city.
