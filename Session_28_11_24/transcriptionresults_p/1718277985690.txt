 I feel really good here. A lot of life and a pretty cheerful place. There's a lot of life here, life in place, and that's why I feel really good over here. And so many different faces, so many different people from different backgrounds, and you can just observe everybody, just sit here with a bagel or a croissant and make a good place to just listen to music while you're chilling, having a cup of coffee, tea, or just eating a snack. Or you get bored of your like monotonous routine or work and everything and you just want to chill. So yeah, it's a nice place if you want to see some liveliness in life. So yeah, I feel good here.
