 Okay so I'm at the corner of Spiegelstrasse and it's nice to do city center corner. I see a lot of different type of commercial shops all around me. I see a lot of people shopping around and having lunch and there's like a nice summer sun. There is a lot of bustle here. I see people relaxing. I see a lot of children playing as well. I see a couple of buses around the corner. There are a bunch of people who are just you know sitting around and having an ice cream or having a good talk. It's a nice city corner everywhere. It's quite peaceful as well.
