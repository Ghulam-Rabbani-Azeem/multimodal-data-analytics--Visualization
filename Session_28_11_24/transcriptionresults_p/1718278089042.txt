 Okay, so this place is quite bustling. There's a lot of noise, a lot of hustle, but it's a nice kind of noise, a nice kind of hustle. There are people having fun, just talking, cycling around, having an ice cream. I see a lot of children as well. I see a few birds here and there. I see people driving around on scooters, on cycles. There are a bunch of coffee shops where people are sitting around. So it's all really relaxing and calming. It's the typical summer touch. It's a very nice and calm breeze flowing around the corner, so it's very peaceful and nice. I wouldn't say it's quiet, but it's really peaceful and really nice.
