 The place I am standing right now seems to be a very central area. There are lot of restaurants, grocery stores as well as shopping areas for people. There are some residential buildings on top of these restaurants as well. Other than that the road itself is very crowded. It is highly populated. It seems to be, as I said, it seems to be a very central place. People are just walking on their feet. There is no traffic at all. I think the road is blocked or the vehicles are not allowed to move around in this area. Other than that it is a very lively place. A lot of things happening right now. Some people are enjoying their food. Others are having groceries, buying their groceries. Others are having fun with their family members, going out, just having a good walk. The overall place seems to be very lively.
