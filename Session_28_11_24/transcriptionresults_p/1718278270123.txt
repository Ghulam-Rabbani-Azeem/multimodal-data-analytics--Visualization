 All in all I feel very connected to the place because it seems like there are plenty of options from which I can choose for example I can have a good meal over here or I can like do window shopping maybe and the whole number the amount of people they make it like a very lively place to be in and the weather is quite pleasant at the moment because of the clouds and there are a lot of shelters available as well below the restaurants or on the sides where we can stand when it gets sunny and by just by looking at the whole street people seem to be enjoying themselves which makes the overall mood very pleasant.
