 Okay, I am currently walking around the Trossa. This is a very cool and very funky type of inner city road and I see a lot of different shops all around me with a variety of things. I see a tat parlor on the corner. I see a very fancy restaurant with a lot of medieval paintings all around it. I see a bunch of coffee houses as well. A couple of commercial shops. So a variety of different shops and it's a very cool place. Of course there are cars and it's a little bit noisy but not that noisy. It's not too annoying. It's really nice to just sit around and have a cup of coffee.
