 I feel intrigued here especially by this medieval restaurant it makes me want to go in and explore the menu and their interior designing and I take pictures of it and look up more into it what this is and because of that it sort of makes everything else in this area very bland and uninteresting especially because of how much this building really stands out and because that it just sort of like everything else just pales in comparison to it so other than that I feel a bit exhausted because I've been walking for quite a while the sun's been out and it's getting warm because of that and can't find a place to sit over here in the street maybe that's also why I feel a bit tired but yeah this this new this hotel looks really intriguing and it's like a breath of fresh air
