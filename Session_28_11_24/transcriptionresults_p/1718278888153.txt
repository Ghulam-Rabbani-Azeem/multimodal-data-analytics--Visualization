 I feel connected to the place in a sense that I am very excited to at least have a drink or just see from the inside how the Golden's Fab restaurant looks like. The overall street has many things to offer but right now I don't need a haircut or have to do my groceries so not particularly interested in other things. But overall the road seems to be quite pleasant and not too crowded which makes it like a good place to chance for the moment.
