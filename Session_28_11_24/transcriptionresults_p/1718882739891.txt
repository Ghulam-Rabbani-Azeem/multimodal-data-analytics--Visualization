 So I'm in my favorite place. There is a cafe, beautiful one, some shopping centers, although some of them are closed, but still I feel like relaxing and it's like I'm spending my leisure. Some memories came like gathering with friends in cafes or do shopping and so many good vibes because of this ambience. So because of some history and backup I have on my mind, it feels really relaxed and just my favorite place.
