 It's a relatively warm spring day so here there are lots of people who are sitting outside and eating. There are lots of restaurants and many shops here. I think here is the city center so there are more public transportation like buses. There are lots of people here. It's a little crowded but it's not annoying. People are walking around, shopping, eating and it is surrounded by buildings. I can see a street here and I think a cinema. There are some billboards and yeah.
