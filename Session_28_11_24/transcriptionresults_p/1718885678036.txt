 I'm not sure if I came in the correct location or not, but this street is like a private street, I don't know, or like a private parking. I'm not sure the specific or the true description of this place. There is a beautiful garden here with flower rows and there are some autos in parking. And there are buildings, I'm not sure it belongs to which company, and there are trees and I can listen to the sounds of birds. And also I can see some bicycles and that's it.
