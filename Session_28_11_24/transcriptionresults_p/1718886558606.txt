 Here is the intersection of several streets. There are many buildings on both sides of the street. Some of them are shopping centers and some of them are residential buildings, I think. There are lots of cars. I can see a bus stop near here. There are people who are walking around, but not as much as previous spots. I feel safe, but not relaxed here.
